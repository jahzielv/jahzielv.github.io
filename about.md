### Stuff you should know about me!
i
-   I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology! #THWg

*   My degree threads (areas of concentration) are Systems & Architecture and People. I love all software development, but I'm especially passionate about tooling and computer systems design: browser development, language and compiler design, and operating systems.

-   Favorite languages: C, JavaScript, and Go! (Currently learning Rust)

-   My leadership skills have been pretty well honed through the years. I've lead my campus ministry’s music team for 3 years. I also headed up IT support for a primary client at Ambitechstrous IT LLC while still in high school. During Summer 2019, I was Project Managing an all-intern team at State Farm. Through these experiences, I’ve been able to learn how to work with diverse teams to reach common goals.

-   When I’m not doing computer things (either for work or for fun!) you can usually find me:
    -   Doing outdoor sports (camping, backpacking, rock climbing);
    -   Reading;
    -   Playing music (I play acoustic and electric guitar, bass guitar, and percussion);
    -   Or catching up on my favorite TV shows and movies!

### And that’s me in a nutshell!
