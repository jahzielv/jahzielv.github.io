### Stuff you should know about me!

-   I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology! #THWg
-   My degree threads (areas of concentration) are Systems & Architecture and Intelligence. I love all software development, but I'm especially passionate about the Web! I love working across the Web stack, from React frontend apps to APIs.
-   Within the world of the Web, I'm most passionate about Open Web standards. Open Source is one of my favorite aspects of working in software. I enjoy how the Open Source mentality drives the development of the Web platform. I've started writing documentation for ECMA 402, the Internationalization subcommittee of ECMA TC39\. Working with ECMA 402 has given me some great exposure to the standards world. My career goal is to work on Open Web standards design and implementation full time.
-   Favorite languages: JavaScript and Go!
-   My leadership skills have been pretty well honed through the years. I've lead my campus ministryâ€™s music team for 3 years. I also headed up IT support for a primary client at Ambitechstrous IT LLC while still in high school. During Summer 2019, I was Project Managing an all-intern team at State Farm. Through these experiences, Iâ€™ve been able to learn how to work with diverse teams to reach common goals.
-   When Iâ€™m not doing computer things (either for work or for fun!) you can usually find me:
    -   Playing [kendama](https://youtu.be/gBy9Vs5YByo?t=109) (that's NOT me in the video btw ðŸ˜…);
    -   Doing outdoor sports (camping, backpacking, rock climbing);
    -   Reading;
    -   Playing music (I play acoustic and electric guitar, bass guitar, and percussion);
    -   Or catching up on my favorite TV shows and movies!

### And thatâ€™s me in a nutshell!
