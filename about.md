### Stuff you should know about me!

-   I'm a software engineer at [Ketch](https://ketch.com), where I work on building infrastructure for data privacy and governance.

-   I'm a proud Georgia Tech alumnus! I graduated in December 2020 with my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science.

-   I love all software development, but I'm especially passionate about tooling and systems programming.

-   Favorite languages: C, Rust, and Go!

-   When I’m not doing computer things (either for work or for fun!) you can usually find me:
    -   Running (preferably on a trail!)
    -   Reading;
    -   Playing music (I play acoustic and electric guitar, bass guitar, and percussion);
    -   Or catching up on my favorite TV shows and movies!

### And that’s me in a nutshell!
