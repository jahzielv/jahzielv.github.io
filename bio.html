    <h1>Stuff you should know about me!</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>
            I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science from the Georgia Institute
            of Technology! #THWg
        </li>
        <li>
            My degree threads (areas of concentration) are Systems & Architecture and
            Intelligence. I love all software development, but I'm especially passionate
            about the Web! I love working across the Web stack, from React frontend apps
            to APIs.
        </li>
        <li>
            Within the world of the Web, I'm most passionate about Open Web standards.
            Open Source is one of my favorite aspects of working in software. I enjoy
            how the Open Source mentality drives the development of the Web platform.
            I've started writing documentation for ECMA 402, the Internationalization
            subcommittee of ECMA TC39. Working with ECMA 402 has given me some great
            exposure to the standards world. My career goal is to work on Open Web
            standards design and implementation full time.

        <li>Favorite languages: JavaScript and Go!</li>

            My leadership skills have been pretty well honed through the years. I've
            lead my campus ministryâ€™s music team for 3 years. I also headed up IT
            support for a primary client at Ambitechstrous IT LLC while still in high
            school. During Summer 2019, I was Project Managing an all-intern team at
            State Farm. Through these experiences, Iâ€™ve been able to learn how to work
            with diverse teams to reach common goals.

            When Iâ€™m not doing computer things (either for work or for fun!) you can
            usually find me:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Playing
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/gBy9Vs5YByo?t=109">kendama</a> (that's NOT
                    me in the video btw ðŸ˜…);
                </li>
                <li>Doing outdoor sports (camping, backpacking, rock climbing);</li>
                <li>
                    Reading;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Playing music (I play acoustic and electric guitar, bass guitar, and
                    percussion);
                </li>
                <li>
                    Or catching up on my favorite TV shows and movies!
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <h3>And thatâ€™s me in a nutshell!</h3>
