# Hello, Dev! ðŸ‘‹

Hi y'all! I'm Jahziel, a Computer Science undergrad at Georgia Tech. I've been occasionally blogging for a little while now, but I'm very new to the Dev platform. I'm hoping to use this bigger platform to encourage me to blog some more! Expect posts on systems programming, my learning adventures (currently learning C++ and Rust), Web stuff (especially JavaScript), and general reflections on software development. Talk to you soon!

Cheers,

### Jahz.
