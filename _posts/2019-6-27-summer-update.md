# Update - Summer Edition

## New Job! üë®‚Äçüíª

The primary reason for my lack of posting has been my new summer internship at State Farm. I was brought on as a Software Development intern working on the APIs and infrastructure behind State Farm's claims operations. I was really excited to start my first real software engineering job, and have learned quite a bit about what it's like to be an enterprise software developer. Some brief thoughts on my experience so far:

-   whEW enterprise software takes a TON of infrastructure! _Scale_ is one of the most common buzzwords in software nowadays, but working at a company as large as State Farm has really shown me that supporting software at scale involves a lot of moving parts. The APIs that I was working with regularly got over a million hits per day, which is totally mindboggling. I'd never worked with software at this sort of scale, so it was fun to get my first experiences with what it takes to make it all work!

-   Companies, please take care of your interns. State Farm has done an incredible job of making sure that their interns feel appreciated and special. While it might seem selfish for interns to expect cool outings or lots of swag, small things like that often make the difference in an intern's experience at a company. Just as important is the experience that interns have while actually doing work. I've really appreciated being placed on a small team (we're 8 people including our manager and myself). I sit right next to my mentor, who's pretty awesome and always ready to answer any questions I might have. At my previous company, I wasn't even on the same floor as my mentor, and he wasn't even in the software engineering field at all. State Farm, you're doing it right!

-   Corporate environments have their own share of difficulties. Probably the biggest caveat from my perspective is the lack of speed. Although State Farm does value quality developer experience and moving quickly, it's hard to move any large group of people quickly in any direction. While each team is small and has ownership over its product, tools, software, and software are managed at the department level. Coming from working on software on my own machine and being able to install any tool or software that I want, it was tough to adjust to living within State Farm's constraints. Also, I haven't used Windows regularly in years and it's pretty rough, let me tell you. It's my own fault for not asking for a MacBook early on though ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## First Dev Conference! üë®‚Äçüíª

I also recently returned from my very first developer's conference! [Dinosaur.js](https://dinosaurjs.org/) was a huge blast and definitely feels like the best way to get started with conferences. It was small enough that it was very accessible to a student like me, but still had all the feeling and amenities of a larger conference. I was also inspired to start thinking about creating my own talk. Look for a blog post about my experience and musings about a possible talk coming soon!

## Lots of Open Sourcing üöÄ

I've taken it on myself to get as active as possible in Open Source this summer. I've been working on a handful of projects, but I've been focussing mainly on writing MDN docs and [Resumic](https://github.com/resumic/schema) this summer.

Writing MDN docs has been a really great experience throughout this year, and I look forward to being able to contribute even more after finishing this round of docs! I've been writing pages for the [Intl.Locale](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Locale) object, which recently landed in the spec and is shipping in Chrome 74 and greater. This new object makes the internationalization API much easier to work with, and learning about it has led to me becoming somewhat of a i18n and Unicode nerd. Look for some blog posts about Intl.Locale coming soon as well!

Resumic is a really cool project as well; we're building a better way for developers to create and maintain a resume, using a JSON schema to hold the data and a Go CLI to turn that JSON into a resume in HTML, PDF, and more. It's been a fun way to learn Go, a language I'd heard a lot about but hadn't actually worked with before this project. There's a definite learning curve, especially coming from JavaScript, which is pure anarchy compared to the tightly regulated world of Go. Strong typing and heavy opinions make development smoother in the long run however, and I'm looking forward to getting more familiar with the language as I work on this project. If you're looking for a great way to get started with Go and/or OSS, go check the repo out! (HAHA GET IT)

It's a packed summer! I'm going to try to get back on a regimen of posting here more frequently, especially since I've got a backlog of like 5 or 6 posts that I want to write üòù. Check back frequently for more!

### Cheers,
