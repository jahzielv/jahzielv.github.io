## New Job! 👨‍💻

The primary reason for my absence was the start of my new summer intership at State Farm. I was brought on as a Software Development intern working on the APIs and infrastructure behind State Farm's claims operations. I was really excited to start my first real software engineering job, and have learned quite a bit about what it's like to be an enterprise software developer.

## Hello
