title: Updates! and a new app!
---

I hate it when people note that they've been bad at posting on their blog. If anyone reads your blog with any regularity, they _know_ that you fell off the wagon. No need to reiterate. So I won't make a cliche comment about how I've been bad about posting lately :P

Anyways, another week (or two... or three...), another app. My latest creation is called [Solarized Cheat Sheet](https://solarized-ref.glitch.me) - a faster way to access Solarized color codes. In case you hadn't noticed, I really really love Solarized! It's hands down my favorite color scheme for things like editors, terminals, and of course, this website! Actually, one of the main reasons I wanted to transition to a made-from-scratch site was to be able to use Solarized colors to implement a dark mode for the site. Since I use these colors so much, I visit [Ethan Schoonover's site](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) often to get the hex and RGB values for the color scheme. While I was working on another project, I realized that it would be great to have a color swatch for Solarized - a set of labelled samples of each of the colors. It was a short jump from there to my cheat sheet, which is just a grid of rectangles in the Solarized colors. When you hover over a color sample, it flips to reveal a group of buttons, one for each color code (hex, RGB, HSB, etc.). Click on the button, and that color code value gets copied to your clipboard! It's super simple, but hopefully handy for people that want to use Solarized and want a quick visual reference.

I've also been working on another app, this time with my good friend Allan Serna. It's called purplepundit.co -
