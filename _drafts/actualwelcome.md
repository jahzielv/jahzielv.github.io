# Hello MTV - Welcome To My Crib

Hi there! Good to see you! Like the new place? Me too! I'm really excited to share this most recent project with you all.

## Use the Platform

The idea of actually writing my own personal site had been floating around in my head ever since last semester when I discovered the joys of web dev, but had never really been a serious thought until recently. I realized that the work I'd been doing had mostly been stuff with frameworks; those ubiquitous layers of abstraction that make it easier to get things done - or at least create even _higher_ levels of abstraction for building apps on the web. It dawned on me, however, that really those frameworks aren't really doing anything magical. They're using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, just like websites have for almost all of the history of the web. So I decided that I would try to create something without any frameworks like React, just with the basic building blocks of the web. And what better thing to make than that website I'd thought of but never built! While using hosted, prebuilt solutions like WordPress (what I'd used until now) is still my suggestion to most people that want to build a website, I wanted to get the experience with working directly with the guts of the web. There's so much about these basic tools that I don't know about, and while I'm very grateful to the library and framework people for making it easier to build cool stuff fast, I think that as with all layers of abstraction, you lose a connection to the underlying systems when you only use frameworks. So I decided to make my website!
