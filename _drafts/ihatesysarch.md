# Why people hate systems programming...

## and how to make them love it

### Outline 

- **Thesis**: Systems programming is difficult. It doesn't have to be as scary or as hard to get into as it currently is. Both traditional and non-traditional education groups can improve how they teach systems programming. IMO, every engineer can benefit from knowing some minimal amount of systems programming – at least how a computer works.
- Intro:
  - 
- Body 1: what's broken about systems education
  - Academia: it's too caustic/negative
  - Non-trad: it's non-existent to a large degree
- Body 2: can we fix it? yes we can!
  - Academia: don't beat people up or scare them out of sysarch
  - Non-trad: offer some courses in systems programming
  - Why should people care about systems?
    - BECAUSE THEY PROGRAM COMPUTERS
    - Other disciplines don't have anywhere near as much "accessibility" as software, yet sw is just (and in many cases more) important in the world scope
    - 
- Body 3: I like systems! How can I help?
  - Make content!
    - Millions of React tutorials, 0 libc porting tutorials
    - Matt Brubeck's browser engine tutorial is a great example
    - We need more content to educate folks that might be interested but never start because they don't know *where* to start.
  - What will I do?
    - Start creating more systems centered stuff
      - Blog posts on dev.to (and jahz.co) about OS stuff I've learned
      - Walking through
