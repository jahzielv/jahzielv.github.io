# My Dinosaur.js Experience! ðŸ¦–



Earlier this summer, I went to my first dev conference ever! I wanted to write a little about the experience (even if it was a little while ago) and share my thoughts on how conferences work, especially for folks considering going to their first one.



## Choosing Dino.js

The market is replete with conferences for all kinds of people, which made the task of choosing just one quite difficult ðŸ˜­ I knew that I wanted to go to a Web/JavaScript specific conference, which unfortunately didn't help out with narrowing down the field of options. After some browsing, I came across JSConf, which is _the_ JavaScript conference. While it looked pretty awesome this year, it's pretty dang expensive for anyone, let alone a college student with a tight budget. I was disappointed when I saw the ticket prices, but I _did_ find out about the JSConf Family of conferences. JSConf has created a federation of associated conferences, which all run under the same Code of Conduct. I looked through the list of associated events, and found Dino.js! I was mostly drawn in by the quirky name, but realized that it was a solid event that was in my price range and seemed to offer everything I was looking for. I finalized my choice, booked my flights, and was ready to get my dino on!
