# PWAnimals - a first PWA!

Hello there! This week was kind of rough for me in terms of motivation, so of course I turned to the perfect source of
coding motivation - a new project! I've listened to many a podcast about PWAs and Service Worker, so I decided yesterday that I'd go ahead and try to build
a PWA in one day or bust. To my shock, it actually wasn't that hard! Read on for a description of what I did, as well as tips and tricks that I learned while building it.

## What does it do?

First off, if you haven't checked the app out, head to [pwanimals.glitch.me](https://pwanimals.glitch.me) to see it in action! As you can see, it's super simple:
it displays a random picture of an animal, and reloads a fresh animal pic when you press the button. If you're offline, the app's UI still loads,
but the button is disabled and informs you that you're offline. Additionally, when you create Pretty basic stuff, but I figured I'd start small :P

One of the main things I wanted to get out of my day of learning
